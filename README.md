# 100-days-of-code-challenge-
100 days of code challenge in Python
<br>
I have added day 1-15 on the same day as I have already completed 15 days of the challenge before creating this repository
<br>
I will continue adding from day 16- day 100 every day from 29/12/2023
<br>

Everyday I learn some concept of Python and make a mini-project using it, for example blackjack project and the Quiz project. Also I have been learning Turtle in Python and have created a Snake Game(the one we used
<br>
to play in our childhood). I have added that project as a seperate Github repository
